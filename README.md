# Real Estate Listings Scraper

This project is a full-stack web application that scrapes real estate listings from Zillow using the Firecrawl API. The application features a React frontend and a Node.js backend, which work together to fetch and display the latest real estate listings.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the use of the Firecrawl API to scrape real estate listings from Zillow and present them in a user-friendly interface. The frontend is built with React, and the backend is built using Node.js and Express. The data is fetched by making an API call to the backend, which in turn scrapes the listings and returns them to the frontend for display.
